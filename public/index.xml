      <description>Introduction This document gives a preliminary outline of the readings for the PhD macro reading group for the fall semester 2019 at TSE. The overall topic of the reading group this semester focusses on macro development, although a couple of seminal non-development macro papers will be discussed as well. The schedule of the reading group will consist of a number of semi-independent parts that will all take between 1 to 3 weeks.</description>

      <description>I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development and the underlying causes of such economy-wide changes. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates not only to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy, but also to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels.</description>
