      <description>The credibility revolution of the past decades in Economics and the social sciences in general has had a tremendous impact. Everyone talks about identification strategies and causal effects, about treatments and various treatment effects. I laud this general development, though in my opinion it has also led many research agendas to be guided by fairly reductionist accounts of causality. We are looking for THE causal effect from education to income, from THE causal effect from institutions to economic growth, from THE causal effect from x to y.</description>

      <description>This document is a work in progress trying to capture my research agenda and underlying research philosophy. I do not believe that Science evolves linearly and while I believe it is generally laudible to be driven by fundamental, society-relevant questions, I also believe that a lot of progress in Science happens from applying new methods. My own research is thus a combination of being attracted to specific fundamental questions and specific methods.</description>

      <title>Replicability 0 - Introduction</title>

      <description>This post is the start of a series on replicability practices. Replicability and the replication crisis across many/most science disciplines (links) is a major issue that affects human knowledge production in general, specifically all realms where decision-making, (scientific) research and the public interact in some way. Arguably, replicability has always been a major issue for scientific research. The history of science is full of poorly designed experiments (quote; Nazis, Duflo RCT example on ethics, prior physics, chemistry research?</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to introduce a few helpful tools to manage one’s workflow in R (specifically RStudio). While this serves as a reminder for myself, I still hope this is helpful for a few people.
There are different reasons to use the different tools I outline below; not all of which might be important to all kinds of research projects. Let’s start out with the most fundamental, which I personally use for any research; no matter whether it is a small personal project or a larger project where I collaborate with others.</description>

      <description>This post deals with a general topic I have long thought about and which touches upon many different areas of applied work. I recently attended a conference on the developmental origins of economic preferences here in Toulouse, organized by the wonderful Institute for Advanced Studies Toulouse, which put this topic back on my mind and made me want to write this piece. Specifically, there were two encounters or observations that spawned my interest.</description>

      <description>Intro My research interests span across disciplines and subdisciplines. I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development. To understand this process of development better, my research focusses on three different angles. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of processes of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates not only to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy, but also to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels.</description>
