      <description>This document is a work in progress trying to capture my research agenda and underlying research philosophy. I do not believe that Science evolves linearly and while I believe it is generally laudible to be driven by fundamental, society-relevant questions, I also believe that a lot of progress in Science happens from applying new methods. My own research is thus a combination of being attracted to specific fundamental questions and specific methods.</description>

      <description>This post is the start of a series on replicability practices. Replicability and the replication crisis across many/most science disciplines (links) is a major issue that affects human knowledge production in general, specifically all realms where decision-making, (scientific) research and the public interact in some way. Arguably, replicability has always been a major issue for scientific research. The history of science is full of poorly designed experiments (quote; Nazis, Duflo RCT example on ethics, prior physics, chemistry research?</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to introduce a few helpful tools to manage one’s workflow in R (specifically RStudio). While this serves as a reminder for myself, I still hope this is helpful for a few people.
There are different reasons to use the different tools I outline below; not all of which might be important to all kinds of research projects. Let’s start out with the most fundamental, which I personally use for any research; no matter whether it is a small personal project or a larger project where I collaborate with others.</description>

      <description>This post deals with a general topic I have long thought about and which touches upon many different areas of applied work. I recently attended a conference on the developmental origins of economic preferences here in Toulouse, organized by the wonderful Institute for Advanced Studies Toulouse, which put this topic back on my mind and made me want to write this piece. Specifically, there were two encounters or observations that spawned my interest.</description>
