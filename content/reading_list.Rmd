## Introduction

You can find the reading lists from previous semesters here: 

- [2019](https://www.jonasgathen.com/reading_list_old2019.html)

This document gives the preliminary readings for the PhD macro reading group for the spring semester 2020 at TSE. The overall topic of the reading group focusses on macro development, although a couple of seminal non-development macro papers will be discussed as well. The schedule of the reading group will consist of a number of semi-independent parts that will all take between 1 to 3 weeks. PhD students wanting to participate in a few sessions of the reading group should seek to commit at least for entire parts. Below, each section will outline readings for a separate part. **Readings in bold are required reading before each session**. Other readings listed are optional readings that may also be discussed during the sessions or can be read afterwards. 

## Part 1: Public & Industrial Policy

Here we will look at optimal industrial and public policy in developing countries. We are excited to read two recent papers that take different approaches to make a case for industrial policies in the development process

### Session 1 (Date: 9.01., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Industrial policy with production networks

Liu, E. (2019). Industrial policies in production networks. Quarterly Journal of Economics

### Session 2 (Date: 16.01., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Development-dependent Ramsey problem

Itskhoki, O., & Moll, B. (2019). Optimal Development Policies With Financial Frictions. Econometrica, 87(1), 139-173.

## Part 2: Political Economy

This part focusses on the large literature on Political Economy. There are multiple subliteratures that are potentially of interest from a macro-development perspective. Here, we focus on two important parts of the literature. The first looks at the role of State Capacity as there is wide consensus in the development community that it determines long-run development. This is also a nice complement to the industrial and public policy part as public policies require state capacity. In the second session, we look at the role of political transitions and fundamental differences between political regimes. 

### Session 1 (Date: 23.01., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) State Capacity

Acemoglu, D. (2005). Politics and economics in weak and strong states. Journal of monetary Economics, 52(7), 1199-1226.

**Acemoglu, D., García-Jimeno, C., & Robinson, J. A. (2015). State capacity and economic development: A network approach. American Economic Review, 105(8), 2364-2409.**

### Session 2 (Date: 30.01., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Political Transitions and Regime differences

## Part 3: Geographic diffusion and spatial development

In this part we will take a look at two related subliteratures. In the first session we take a look at recent progress in the literature on technology diffusion. 

### Session 1 (Date: 06.02., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Technology diffusion

This week's paper shows that there are considerable time lags and differences in adoption intensity in the diffusion of technologies across countries. The paper tries to show that these two facets of technology diffusion can explain most of the evolution of cross-country income differences over the last 200 years. 

**Comin, D., & Mestieri, M. (2018). If technology has arrived everywhere, why has income diverged?. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 10(3), 137-78.**

### Session 2 (Date: 13.02., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) 

In this session we look at recent papers that model jointly the spatial/geographic dispersion of economic activity and the process of development. We will read the first of the two papers below, because it links more nicely with the technology diffusion paper from the session before. 

**Desmet, K., & Rossi-Hansberg, E. (2014). Spatial development. American Economic Review, 104(4), 1211-43.**

Desmet, K., Nagy, D. K., & Rossi-Hansberg, E. (2018). The geography of development. Journal of Political Economy, 126(3), 903-983.


## Part 4: Trade models (continued from last semester)

Given that there is a high demand for further trade-related papers, we use this part to look at newer papers that try to quantify the gains of trade. These are not specifically on development but have important consequences for development. 

Arkolakis, C., Costinot, A., & Rodríguez-Clare, A. (2012). New trade models, same old gains?. American Economic Review, 102(1), 94-130.

Melitz, M. J., & Redding, S. J. (2015). New trade models, new welfare implications. American Economic Review, 105(3), 1105-46.


## Part 5: "New Organizational Macro"

In this part, we will look at a number of papers that could be subsumed under the heading of organizational economics (looking at hierarchies and management within firms or organizations) but have a clear macro-twist. 

### Session 1 () Firm dynamics in developing countries

**Akcigit, U., Alp, H., & Peters, M. (2019). Lack of selection and limits to delegation: firm dynamics in developing countries. Working Paper**

Hsieh, C. T., & Klenow, P. J. (2014). The life cycle of plants in India and Mexico. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129(3), 1035-1084.
