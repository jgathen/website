# Abstract

This paper quantifies the general equilibrium costs of political connections in Indonesia under the authoritarian rule of Suharto at the end of the 1990s. I build a structural model of political connections where connected firms benefit from output subsidies and endogenously spend resources on rent-seeking activities and estimate the model using rich firm-level manufacturing data and the measure of politically connected firms by Mobarak and Purbasari (2006). I show how to non-parametrically identify the output subsidy from variations in total factor revenue productivity (TFPR) between similar connected and non-connected firms, allowing for flexible correlation between connections and underlying firm-specific productivity and demand processes. In general equilibrium, both the distribution and the extent of subsidies to connected firms matters. For the case of Indonesia, I find that political connections cost between 1.5-6.9% of aggregate output. At most 30% of these output costs can be explained by misallocation of factors of production. The large remainder is explained by subsidizing connected firms instead of putting saved subsidies to more productive use.
