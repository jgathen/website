In this paper, I contribute to the question of how much political connections, patronage and cronyism matter for broader questions of economic development. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, I develop a model that provides a framework with which one can realistically analyze and quantify various channels through which political connections influence development. The model is general enough to encompass various forms of political connections, patronage and cronyism, while at the same time is able to quantitatively match main moments of a developing economy, including employment shares across broad occupations and heterogeneity across individuals and firms. The size of occupations and the productivity distribution of firms is endogenously determined and depends on the role of political connections in the economy. 

The second contribution of this paper is empirical by applying this model to the case study of Indonesia. Using a combination of rich household-level and firm-level panel data as well as a number of quasi-experimental moments from the literature that are specifically estimated for Indonesia, I can identify key parameters in the model to provide more robust evidence for the role of politics in development.

To my knowledge, my paper is the first to provide a general quantitative macroeconomic model that allows structural estimation of the costs of political connections and cronyism in terms of output, structural change across occupations and productivity distributions across and within occupations. In my model, the government provides productive institutions and infrastructure that are financed through taxation. Political connections let actors in the economy avoid part of these taxes and thus exert a negative externality on others. The quality of institutions in turn affects the profitability of firms influencing endogenous firm entry, the productivity distribution of firms and the relative size of sectors in the economy. Political connections thus generate two main distortions: (1) A distortion along the extensive margin: lower taxes lead to worse infrastructure and thus to fewer entrepreneurs and a smaller firm sector. (2) A distributional distortion which leads to some incompetent but politically-connected individuals to run firms while other competent but non-connected individuals decide not to run a firm.
