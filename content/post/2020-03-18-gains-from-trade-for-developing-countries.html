<p>In Banerjee’s and Duflo’s recent book “Good Economics for Hard Times” (see here), there is a whole chapter on the gains of trade and this has generated some discussion. While they make a number of different points in the chapter, there are two I found particularly relevant for developing countries:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>gains are not large, especially not for large countries (who can produce almost everything)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>If true, this has significant implications for policies in developing countries.</p>
<p>Arkolakis et al (2012) look at the gains of trade and show that recent trade models can summarize the gains from trade in two sufficient statistics:
- the share of expenditure on domestic goods
- trade elasticity</p>
<p>This leads them to conclude that for large countries like the US that see the percentage of domestic demand fulfilled by imports at around 7% (year 2000) and some common estimates of the trade elasticity, gains from trade range from 0.7 percent to 1.4 percent of real income.</p>
<p>These results depend on the following assumptions: 1. Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, 2. one factor of production, 3. linear cost functions, 4. perfect or monopolistic competition and some additional macro-level restrictions including that the import-demand system is CES (does this rule out key inputs?)</p>
<p>Setup means that goods are only used for final consumption and Dixit-Stiglitz preferences means that individuals can consume from a continuum of goods and like variety so that they will want to consume from each of the goods. This captures only parts of how we think about trade for developing countries. Developing countries import goods such as airplanes, cars or specialized machines that cannot be produced locally. Even closest substitutes within the developing country might not come close to being a good substitute. This questions the modeling choice of CES + love for variety. Either allow for hierarchy of technologies with vintages (newer versions of similar technologies such as modern computers being the newest vintage of the typewriter) or specify that some goods can only be produced when having access to a specific technology.</p>
<p>and would be more in line with something like</p>
<p>While these can be either final consumption goods or intermediate production inputs, it is not clear whether they are captured well by a demand specification of differentiated products. Rather,</p>
<p>First, developing countries import a lot of intermediate products that are used in the production process. Even if we explicitly model this, there is an important question on the substitutability of these goods with local intermediate goods.</p>
<p>Discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>growth effects of trade (Arkolakis et al only look at static changes)</li>
<li>effect of trade on market power, political connections, etc.</li>
<li>O-ring theory of development (maybe developing countries cannot produce all goods that US can produce)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
