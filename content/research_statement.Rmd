I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development and the underlying causes of such economy-wide changes. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates not only to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy, but also to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels.

Methodologically, I try to combine computational macro models with detailed data and causally identified moments from the burgeoning empirical literature on the political economy of development. In this sense, my work tries to build realistic, data-driven models that help us understand the fundamental mechanisms of economy-wide development processes - or in the case where such models fail - shed light on flaws in our theories that can help build better theories. 

In one of my papers, I look at the role of political connections in the development process by building a heterogeneous occupational choice model. Individuals can work as microentrepreneurs, as permanent employees in firms or run their own firm. Firms pay taxes and these taxes are - with some losses due to corruption and low state capacity - invested in infrastructure and institutions that are productive inputs for firms. Some entrepreneurs running a firm can be politically connected. In this case, they can accumulate political capital buying them government favors and patronage modeled as reductions in taxes or even net transfers. Political connections thus have aggregate effects through their detrimental effect on institutions and can generate distortions (1) along the extensive margin since fewer individuals will find it profitable to become entrepreneurs as institutions are weaker and running a firm is less profitable and (2) along the intensive margin since weak institutions will lead to less capital and labor investments due to complementarities of institutions and factor inputs. This can have large aggregate consequences. It also distorts the cross-sectional distribution of firms as entrepreneurs with bad ideas but good political connections run larger firms than they would otherwise do while individuals with good ideas but bad political connections may run inefficiently small firms or do not even start a firm due to weak institutions.

In other on-going research, I zoom in on the functioning of governments in developing countries. I propose a generally applicable identification strategy for the skill distribution of government workers that helps shed light on the selection process of government workers and their experience accumulation. This is part of a broader project of reconceptualizing state capacity through a production function lense. In such a framework, state capacity is fundamentally determined by the skills of workers who work for the state and how these workers are managed. I then explore a number of ways through which my approach can be used to quantitatively study new and interesting questions related to the study of state capacity. 

I also have a project on the persistence of institutions looking at the long-run consequences of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.
