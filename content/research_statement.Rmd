I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development and the underlying causes of such economy-wide changes. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors interact with and potentially undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy. But it also relates to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels.

Methodologically, I try to combine computational macro models and other structural approaches with detailed data and causally identified moments from the burgeoning empirical literature on the political economy of development. In this sense, my work tries to build realistic, data-driven models that help us understand the fundamental mechanisms of economy-wide development processes - or in the case where such models fail - shed light on flaws in our theories that can help build better theories. 

In one of my papers, I look at the role of political connections in the development process by building a model of a rich firm-size distribution where political connections distort the scale of production. Drawing on direct evidence that political connections help obtain government favors such as direct input and output subsidies, monopoly rights, market power and tax evasion, I try to quantify the role of connections in distorting the observed firm-size distribution. The simple idea is that politically connected firms are larger than they would be without government help and by building a structural model of this process and observing the actual firm-size distributions across differentially connected firms, I can quantify how much the government is helping connected firms. I combine this with directly modeling the impact of government investments in institutions (such as education and infrastructure) on firm production. This allows to study realistic growth trajectories where transition dynamics are influenced by institutions and their evolution. Political connections thus have aggregate effects through their detrimental effect on institutions. Using the estimates, I can then perform counterfactual growth trajectories without political connections. 

In other on-going research, I zoom in on the functioning of governments in developing countries. I propose a generally applicable identification strategy for the skill distribution of government workers that helps shed light on the selection process of government workers and their experience accumulation. This is part of a broader project of reconceptualizing state capacity through a production function lense. In such a framework, state capacity is fundamentally determined by the skills of workers who work for the state and how these workers are managed. I then explore a number of ways through which my approach can be used to quantitatively study new and interesting questions related to the study of state capacity. 

I also have a project on the persistence of institutions looking at the long-run consequences of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.
