<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document gives a preliminary outline of the readings for the PhD macro reading group for the fall semester 2019 at TSE. The overall topic of the reading group this semester focusses on macro development, although a couple of seminal non-development macro papers will be discussed as well. The schedule of the reading group will consist of a number of semi-independent parts that will all take between 1 to 3 weeks. PhD students wanting to participate in a few sessions of the reading group should seek to commit at least for entire parts. Below, each section will outline readings for a separate part. <strong>Readings in bold are required reading before each session</strong>. Other readings listed are optional readings that may also be discussed during the sessions or can be read afterwards.</p>

<div id="part-1-misallocation-and-development" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1: Misallocation and Development</h2>
<p>Misallocation on factor markets (capital and labor misallocation) provides an important framework with which one can better understand growth and development. Given that any distortion of factor markets can lead to misallocation, numerous different literatures can be framed in terms of “misallocation”. Here, we start with a number of seminal papers, knowing that the idea and discussions of misallocation will come up in different parts of the reading group. The first session will introduce the idea and the second and third sessions focus on misallocations in the capital and labor market respectively.</p>

<h3>Session 3 (Date: ) Labor Misallocation</h3>
<p>There can be multiple drivers of labor misallocation. A number of recent papers have looked at migration/transition costs between sectors/jobs as such sources. As for the case of capital misallocation, plenty of channels are still understudied.</p>

<div id="part-2-structural-change" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 2: Structural Change</h2>
<p>In this part of the reading group, we will pick up another important part in the macro development literature: namely, structural change: employment changes across broad sectors in the economy (e.g. agriculture, industry, services) over the course of development. The first session will review a number of seminal theoretical papers that provide a backbone for further discussions. Session 2 will discuss more recent papers that credibly combine theory and empirics. Session 3 could discuss the role of informality, as this has received a lot of attention in recent years.</p>

<div id="part-3-growth-economic-history" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 3: Growth &amp; Economic history</h2>
<p>Building on the readings on structural change, a natural follow-up question would be why there has been so little structural change in history, or at least so little permanent structural change. There is a large literature at the intersection of Economic History and Growth Economics who look at this in the context of Malthusian models and the transition to more modern growth regimes as captured in Unified Growth theory. While much of this literature is fairly old, the recent surge in good empirical work on Economic History could also offer potentials for quantitative macro approaches combining previous macro models with more recent empirical evidence to give more systematic accounts of development in history.</p>

<p>We could also look at more recent papers that use demography to explain phenomena in the US. E.g.:</p>

<div id="accounting-for-growth-paths" class="section level3">
<h3>Accounting for growth paths</h3>
<p>In this part, we could also look at good applications of models that explain long-run growth of a particular country. A seminal paper is:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="part-4-labor-markets" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 4: Labor markets</h2>
<p>Potentially include a number of more classic papers and then discuss more development-related papers. Some classic, seminal papers could also be related to labor market polarization and directed technological change as these might have interesting consequences for developing countries as well.</p>
<p>Jayachandran, S. (2006). Selling labor low: Wage responses to productivity shocks in developing countries. Journal of political Economy, 114(3), 538-575.</p>
<p>Lagakos, D., Moll, B., Porzio, T., Qian, N., &amp; Schoellman, T. (2018). Life cycle wage growth across countries. Journal of Political Economy, 126(2), 797-849.</p>
<p>Donovan, K., Lu, J., &amp; Schoellman, T. (2018, July). Labor Market Flows and Development. In 2018 Meeting Papers (Vol. 976). Society for Economic Dynamics.</p>
<p>A really good overview on directed technical change, earnings inequality and polarization is given in:</p>
<p>Acemoglu, D., &amp; Autor, D. (2011). Skills, tasks and technologies: Implications for employment and earnings. In Handbook of labor economics (Vol. 4, pp. 1043-1171). Elsevier.</p>
<p>This has obvious implications for development. For example, how directed technical change is biased towards factor-composition of rich countries and thus even with perfect technology diffusion, we would see cross-country misallocation. See:</p>

</div>
<div id="part-5-trade-and-its-role-for-development" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 5: Trade and its role for development</h2>
<p>There is a huge literature on trade; in this reading group we are interested in how trade fits into the broader picture of development: how does trade effect development. We will try to touch a number of subliteratures.</p>
<div id="session-1-date-consequences-of-globalization" class="section level3">
<h3>Session 1 (Date: ) Consequences of Globalization</h3>
<p>One subliterature we are interested in is asking what are the downstream effects of globalization on developing countries. Globalization has primarily reduced transportation costs and amplified access to global markets. Important papers on this are by Dave Donaldson:</p>
<p>Donaldson, D. (2018). Railroads of the Raj: Estimating the impact of transportation infrastructure. American Economic Review, 108(4-5), 899-934.</p>
<p>Atkin, D., &amp; Donaldson, D. (2015). Who’s getting globalized? The size and implications of intra-national trade costs (No. w21439). National Bureau of Economic Research. (R&amp;R Econometrica)</p>
<p>Especially the second paper is interesting to assess how individuals in developing countries even far away from global markets are affected.</p>

<div id="session-2-date-international-macro-puzzles" class="section level3">
<h3>Session 2 (Date:) International Macro Puzzles</h3>
<p>In the second session, we can look at some standard international macro puzzles and see how the literature has developed since Obstfeld and Rogoff’s famous 6 puzzles and the puzzle of capital flows.</p>

</div>
<div id="part-6-publicindustrial-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 6: Public/Industrial Policy</h2>
<p>One could have a small part (potentially only one session) on recent work on optimal industrial policy in developing countries. There are two recent papers that come to mind that are worth reading carefully, although they are both difficult reads:</p>
<p>Itskhoki, O., &amp; Moll, B. (2019). Optimal Development Policies With Financial Frictions. Econometrica, 87(1), 139-173.</p>

</div>
<div id="part-7-political-economy" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 7: Political Economy</h2>
<p>This part focusses on the large literature on Political Economy. There are multiple subliteratures that are potentially of interest from a macro-development perspective. Here, we focus on two important parts of the literature. The first looks at the role of State Capacity as there is wide consensus in the development community that it determines long-run development. This is also a nice complement to the industrial and public policy part as public policies require state capacity. In the second session, we look at the role of political transitions and fundamental differences between political regimes.</p>

<h2>Further parts?</h2>
<p>There are a number of other areas in Macro-Development that could be highly interesting. Other PhDs might also want to push for some non-development macro topics.</p>
