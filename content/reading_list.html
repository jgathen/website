<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is a new Macro-Development Reading Group at TSE for the academic year 2021-2022. You can find details and the reading list <a href="https://www.jonasgathen.com/RG_Outline_2021.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>You can find the reading lists from previous semesters here:</p>

<p>This document gives the preliminary readings for the PhD macro reading group for the spring semester 2020 at TSE. The overall topic of the reading group focusses on macro development, although a couple of seminal non-development macro papers will be discussed as well. The schedule of the reading group will consist of a number of semi-independent parts that will all take between 1 to 3 weeks. PhD students wanting to participate in a few sessions of the reading group should seek to commit at least for entire parts. Below, each section will outline readings for a separate part. <strong>Readings in bold are required reading before each session</strong>. Other readings listed are optional readings that may also be discussed during the sessions or can be read afterwards.</p>
<div id="part-1-public-industrial-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1: Public &amp; Industrial Policy</h2>
<p>Here we will look at optimal industrial and public policy in developing countries. We are excited to read two recent papers that take different approaches to make a case for industrial policies in the development process</p>

<div id="part-2-political-economy" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 2: Political Economy</h2>
<p>This part focusses on the large literature on Political Economy. There are multiple subliteratures that are potentially of interest from a macro-development perspective. Here, we focus on two important parts of the literature. The first looks at the role of State Capacity as there is wide consensus in the development community that it determines long-run development. This is also a nice complement to the industrial and public policy part as public policies require state capacity. In the second session, we look at the role of political transitions and fundamental differences between political regimes.</p>

<div id="part-3-geographic-diffusion-and-spatial-development" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 3: Geographic diffusion and spatial development</h2>
<p>In this part we will take a look at two related subliteratures. In the first session we take a look at recent progress in the literature on technology diffusion.</p>
<div id="session-1-date-06.02.-330-5pm-salle-de-seminaire-1--1-floor-technology-diffusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Session 1 (Date: 06.02., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Technology diffusion</h3>
<p>This week’s paper shows that there are considerable time lags and differences in adoption intensity in the diffusion of technologies across countries. The paper tries to show that these two facets of technology diffusion can explain most of the evolution of cross-country income differences over the last 200 years.</p>

<div id="session-2-date-13.02.-330-5pm-salle-de-seminaire-1--1-floor" class="section level3">
<h3>Session 2 (Date: 13.02., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor)</h3>
<p>In this session we look at recent papers that model jointly the spatial/geographic dispersion of economic activity and the process of development. We will read the first of the two papers below, because it links more nicely with the technology diffusion paper from the session before.</p>

<div id="part-4-trade-models-continued-from-last-semester" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 4: Trade models (continued from last semester)</h2>
<p>Given that there is a high demand for further trade-related papers, we use this part to look at newer papers that try to quantify the gains of trade. These are not specifically on development but have important consequences for development. The first session looks at static models of trade and the implied static gains.</p>
<div id="session-1-date-26.02.-330-5pm-salle-de-seminaire-1--1-floor-static-gains-from-trade" class="section level3">
<h3>Session 1 (Date: 26.02., 3:30-5pm, Salle de Seminaire 1, -1 floor) Static Gains from Trade</h3>

<p>For developing countries, it is crucial to take into account cross-industry variation in trade elasticities as some industries may depend strongly on imports that cannot be substituted locally (e.g. crucial natural resources or high-tech intermediate inputs that cannot be produced domestically). Two important papers in this regard are:</p>
