<p>I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development and the underlying causes of such economy-wide changes. This is for me the key subject of the field of Macro-Development with the added benefit that the methodological tools in Macro-Development sharpen the focus on processes and changes that truly matter at the aggregate level.</p>
<p>My research interests within Macro-Development are broad: I am interested in growth, structural change and industrial development, long-run changes in income and wealth inequality, entrepreneurship and occupational choices, the role of the government and elites as well as how many of these factors interact over the course of development. Throughout, my research focus is on long-run changes (processes that play out over decades) rather than short- to medium-run changes. Most of my work is on better understanding long-run development processes instead of direct policy questions, but all of my papers have important policy implications.</p>
<p>My current work can be structured into two main related fields of interest: first, the political economy of development (specifically, how the state and private sector interact over the course of development), and second, how we can rigorously disentangle different drivers of long-run economic growth using micro data, while taking seriously that virtually any data on developing countries features non-stationarity.</p>

<h2>The Political Economy of Development (or how the state and private sector interact over the course of development)</h2>
<p>I believe that a major determinant of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. I study this question from two perspectives. On the one hand, I study how economic and political elites may collude for their own benefit, potentially undermining the workings of the economy (Paper on Political Connections). On the other hand, I study how the government interacts with the private sector over the course of development: for example, via the provision of public goods (Paper on Political Connections and the Decentralization Paper) and the evolution of state capacity over time (Work on State Capacity) as well as by affecting who works for the private and public sector over time (Paper on Government Worker selection).</p>
<p>In my paper on Political Connections, I quantify the aggregate costs of political connections by building a model of heterogeneous firms where political connections distort the scale of production and firms endogenously spend resources on rent-seeking. Drawing on a large micro-empirical literature that gives direct evidence that political connections help obtain government favors such as direct input and output subsidies, monopoly rights, market power and tax evasion, I try to quantify the role of connections in distorting the observed firm-size distribution. The key empirical challenge is that in the data, large connected firms may be large because they are very productive, because they receive large subsidies or some combination of the two, with the extent of subsidies being directly correlated with underlying firm characteristics. For example, very productive firms may also be more productive at lobbying and other rent-seeking activities. I show how to separately identify subsidies and firm productivity by making assumptions on how connected firms are selected and show how the entire firm-size distribution of connected firms puts structure on what selection is plausible in the data. Backing out unobserved subsidies non-parametrically, I can then build a rich model of endogenous rent-seeking activities, which I use to understand the distribution of rent-seeking activities across firms and to study the aggregate costs of political connections in general equilibrium. For the case of Indonesia, I find that political connections cost between 1.5-6.9% of aggregate output. At most 30% of these output costs can be explained by misallocation of factors of production. The large remainder is explained by subsidizing connected firms instead of putting saved subsidies to more productive use. In comparison to the literature, besides the novel estimation approach, there are at least two important insights: first, misallocation costs are not necessarily the most important costs of firm-level distortions as opportunity costs of public funds can be large, and second, a few firms (in the Indonesian data about 1% of firms who account for about 10% of output) can cause large aggregate costs.</p>
<p>In other on-going research, I zoom in on the functioning of governments in developing countries. I propose a generally applicable identification strategy for the skill distribution of government workers that helps shed light on the selection process of government workers and their experience accumulation. This is part of a broader project of reconceptualizing state capacity through a production function lense. In such a framework, state capacity is fundamentally determined by the skills of workers who work for the state and how these workers are managed. I then explore a number of ways through which my approach can be used to quantitatively study new and interesting questions related to the study of state capacity.</p>

<h2>Studying long-run growth with micro data to disentangle drivers of growth</h2>
<p>In this second branch of my research, I force myself to take seriously two key insights: first, micro data greatly helps to identify and disentangle model mechanisms and, second, virtually all data from developing countries is non-stationary and features important changes over time including growth in stocks and flows, systematic changes in prices and large compositional effects (such as reallocations of workers across sectors).</p>
<p>In my paper with Oscar Fentanes, we take as starting point 40 years of firm-level panel data on Indonesian manufacturing to show that at the same time as output grew by a factor of twenty, the average firm size doubled and very large firms strongly increased their shares of output and employment. Taking these stylized facts as a starting point, we wonder whether systematic changes in the firm size distribution may explain economic growth more generally, given that economic growth is in the end mechanically linked to changes of value-added output at the firm level. To link these facts, we use a statistical accounting exercise to decompose output growth into aggregate productivity growth, input growth and selection and reallocation effects. We show how to separately identify all terms drawing in part on novel identification results and show that the direct contribution of aggregate productivity for output growth in Indonesia is close to zero. This is surprising given the usually large role attributed to productivity growth in driving aggregate growth.</p>
<p>To explain output growth in the absence of aggregate productivity growth, we build a structural model of firm size dynamics that flexibly captures an endogenous co-evolution of aggregate output growth and changes in the firm size distribution. We directly estimate the model on the plant-level data and show that it fits remarkably well untargeted moments such as the average size and output evolution as well as the entire firm size distribution over time. In the model, output growth is driven by endogenous transition dynamics and we validate this choice via a novel empirical exercise that shows the importance of transition dynamics in Indonesian manufacturing. Growth driven by transition dynamics plays out over a long period of time because (1) it takes time to grow large firms and (2) we find that many firms are far from their optimal size.</p>
<p>This paper shows how to use micro data to disentangle drivers of economic growth and we find that endogenous transition dynamics explain almost all growth in Indonesian manufacturing. This is an important finding for many Macro-Development papers as it directly invalidates a common assumption that micro-data is at their stationary distribution. However, the paper is strongly positive in that it exemplifies how to tractably estimate a rich structural model without imposing that the underlying data is stationary and how to use the entire path of observable equilibria over time to estimate the model and key mechanisms.</p>
