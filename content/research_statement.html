<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>My research interests span across disciplines and subdisciplines. I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development. To understand this process of development better, my research focusses on three different angles. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of processes of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates not only to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy, but also to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels. Linked to this research area is my interest in the field of social and behavioral economics as they relate to processes of development. Here, my academic interests lie much stronger on the changes and evolution of norms and institutions instead of behavioral biases. I believe this field can strongly contribute to our understanding of the political economy of development by enriching our theories and models of how agents act and institutions constrain in specific contexts.</p>

<h2>Political Economy of Development</h2>
<p>The literature on the political economy of development is currently sprawling and has benefitted tremendously from different disciplines and subdisciplines. The integration of insights from the collective choice and rent-seeking literatures both in economics and political science are an important foundation as well as the insights from economic historians and new institutionalists on the importance and workings of institutions. In the last two decades, the literature on the political economy of development has also turned much more empirical and has broadly embraced the credibility revolution. This has put many empirical insights on a much firmer ground. The sprawling of detailed contextual analyses of how political and economic systems coevolve has taught us a lot about the workings of market-politics interactions outside of consolidated democracies. The literature has moved away from simplistic accounts of democratic vs. undemocratic political systems and has looked in depth at different levels of the political hierarchy, at different channels of accountability, at the workings of state bureaucracy, at different levels of state capacity, etc.</p>
<p>In my own research, I seek to contribute to this literature in a number of ways. First, my joint research with Guohui Jiang on Cambodia sheds light on how a post-conflict society deals with the historic experience of trauma and conflict. Ultimately, we are interested to shed further light on how Cambodia’s current political system and the dense clientelistic patronage networks evolved from the end of the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s and how they impacted development since.</p>
<p>Second, in my joint research with Franziska Quoss in Vietnam, we look at specific channels through which the economic and political system intertwine. How do patronage relationships work and how do they distort the economy? We are exploring these questions from multiple angles. We are currently trying to look at how political business cycles are related to the connections between politicians and local firms. How do local firms react prior and after to local elections based on the insight that local politicians and bureaucrats have considerable discretion over regulations that impact firms. In joint field research, we also looked in detail at the phenomenon of tourist markets in Vietnam, which interact with government policies and local politics in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Third, I seek to contribute to the literature by bringing together different insights and stylized facts into a more coherent and encompassing theoretical framework. I currently plan to do so in two different ways. On the one hand, I am currently building a macro heterogeneous agent model based on entrepreneurship of a patronage-based economy. Agents either work in the self-employed low-wage sector, as medium-wage workers for the government or as high-wage entrepreneurs. Government sector jobs are given out to politically connected individuals, while government connections also make it easier for entrepreneurs to expand their business. The model tries to match the distribution of workers and the income and wealth distributions in many developing countries, while giving quantitative estimates of the costs of capital misallocation due to patronage.</p>
<p>In a different future project, I plan to build an agent-based model for the Chinese political system, which can explain career decisions of politicians, explain the evolution of the political system over the last decades and explain the distribution of talent and corruption. This could be used for policy simulations.</p>
