<p>I am fundamentally interested in how societies change in the process of development and the underlying causes of such economy-wide changes. My primary research focus is on the political economy of development. I believe that a major determinant of development is how political and economic institutions and actors intertwine. This relates not only to the focus of the literature on how political institutions and actors undermine the workings of the economy, coopt and distort the economy, but also to how economic changes impact the political system at different levels.</p>
<p>Methodologically, I try to combine computational macro models with detailed data and causally identified moments from the burgeoning empirical literature on the political economy of development. In this sense, my work tries to build realistic, data-driven models that help us understand the fundamental mechanisms of economy-wide development processes - or in the case where such models fail - shed light on flaws in our theories that can help build better theories.</p>
<p>In my master thesis, I look at the role of political connections in the development process by building a heterogeneous occupational choice model. Individuals can work as microentrepreneurs, as permanent employees in firms or run their own firm. Firms pay taxes and these taxes are - with some corruption losses - invested in infrastructure and institutions that are productive inputs for firms. Some entrepreneurs running a firm can be politically connected. In this case, they can accumulate political capital buying them government favors and patronage modeled as reductions in taxes or even net transfers. Political connections thus have aggregate effects through their detrimental effect on institutions and can generate two distinct distortions in the economy: (1) fewer individuals will become entrepreneurs as institutions are weaker thanks to a smaller tax base and (2) the productivity distribution of firms is distorted as entrepreneurs with bad ideas but good political connections may start firms while individuals with good ideas but bad political connections may not want to start a firm due to weak institutions. To assess the aggregate consequences of political connections, I fit the model to the case of Indonesia, using detailed household- and firm-level panel data as well as a number of important empirical moments on political connections (including quasi-experimental moments).</p>
<p>In other on-going research, I zoom in on the functioning of governments in developing countries by studying the evolution of state capacity. I also have a project on the persistence of institutions looking at the long-run consequences of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.</p>
